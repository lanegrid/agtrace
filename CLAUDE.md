- Keep minimal comments and documents.
- Write comments in English.
- Read `docs`.
- When you make a commit, the commit message must be oneline not multiline.
- Rather than rushing to complete tasks, please focus on a quality-driven approach: reviewing implementations, running lint and fmt checks, and committing with concise, one-line messages (messages like “Claude's co-author” are unnecessary—keep them one-line).
