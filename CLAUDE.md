- Keep minimal comments and documents.
- Write comments in English.
- Read `docs`.
- When you make a commit, the commit message must be oneline not multiline.
- For tests:
  - Do NOT run cargo insta review or accept snapshots interactively.
  - If tests fail due to snapshot mismatches, print snapshot diffs to stdout using git diff (or git diff --no-index if needed).
  - Do not modify .snap, .snap.new, or inline snapshots unless ALLOW_SNAPSHOT_UPDATE=1 is explicitly set.
  - When snapshot diffs exist, produce a short report: number of snapshot files changed, which tests/providers affected, and a brief summary of the semantic change.
  - Stop and request approval when snapshot updates are required.
