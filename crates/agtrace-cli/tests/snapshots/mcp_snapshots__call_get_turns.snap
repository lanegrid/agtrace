Create the directory\n2. Create the file with the code\n\nThis is simple enough that I don't need a todo list - it's just 2 quick steps. Let me first check if the myapp directory exists, then create it and the file.\n\nActually, I should use the Write tool to create the file. The Write tool will create the directory if it doesn't exist. Let me just create the file directly.\n\nWait, I should verify first if the directory exists. Actually, looking at the instructions, I should prefer using the dedicated tools. I can just use Write to create the file, and it should handle creating the directory if needed. But let me check first with ls to see if myapp exists.\n\nActually, let me just create the directory first with bash, then write the file. That's clearer.\n\nActually, looking at the instructions more carefully: \"Before executing the command, please follow these steps: Directory Verification: If the command will create new directories or files, first use `ls` to verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location\"\n\nSo I should first verify the parent directory (which is the working directory /Users/test_user/agent-sample). I can see from the env that this is the working directory, so I know the parent exists. Let me create the directory and then the file.",
